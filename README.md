A simple clock written entirely from ChatGPT prompts. List of features:
- invisible in the application bar
- tray icon with "close" option
- transparent background
- changing font depending on the color "underneath"
- moving on the screen
- saving the clock position in the system registry
- optimized as "naked" exe (no CRT, no debug info, no manifest info, no .reloc section)
